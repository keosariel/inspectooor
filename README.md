### Inspectooor

Inspectooor is a tool kinda like your normal browser inspect element tool, but it allows you to inspect elements in a less noisy environment. It allows you change the selected element properties and see the changes in real time.

It was built to test tailwind css properties and see the changes in real time, without having to go back and forth between the code and the browser.
